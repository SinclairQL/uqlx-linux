//  This is a new branch of Uqlx-Mac
//  it is intended for transition from X windows
//  to native Mac screen handling.
//
//  It is also a step on the way to Cocoa.
//  I hope.

//  As yet no work done on this, just a place holder

//  Once this branch is complete, it will be moved over as the main branch to MacQL.
